Description: A set of functions for some multivariate analyses utilizing a
             structural equation modeling (SEM) approach through the 'OpenMx' package.
             These analyses include canonical correlation analysis (CANCORR),
             redundancy analysis (RDA), and multivariate principal component regression (MPCR).
             It implements procedures discussed in Gu and Cheung (2023) <doi:10.1111/bmsp.12301>,
             Gu, Yung, and Cheung (2019) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2018.1512847>, and
             Gu et al. (2023) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2022.2141675>.
